            AwardCo's main focus is to increase recognition within companies. Companies look to Awardco to increase employee morale and create an encouraging workspace. Our task was to solve the problem of informing employees of recognition, rewards, and allow employees to recognize each other in a “one-stop-shop” notification system.

        To kick off our project we began by researching other notification systems. We wanted to know what typical users would love, and loath about notifications. We compiled our competitive analysis together and reviewed options with the design activity 'loved and loathed'. This gave us the head start to ideate what users would expect from a useful notification system. We came up with some 'how might we' questions to further understand our goals.

<h2 class="center-h2">Low Fidelity Design</h2>
<div>
    <h3>June</h3>
    <p>Transitioning from research to low fidelity design comes quickly. We look to solve for how might we increase user activity with paper prototyping. I love to draw multiple rapid designs to help solve our “how might we” questions. Usually I will use a crazy 8s activity to help get the designs going. with the help of other teammates, we decide together what we expect would be the best design, and what we expect our users would want to have. For me, paper to digital produces the most effective results.</p>

        <h3>August</h3>
        <p>This was the data gathering phase. We spent the whole month turning our paper designs into digital designs. We worked our digital designs into prototypes and we worked hard to get customers ready to test and work on what we wanted to know about our customers. </p>

        <h3>September</h3>
        <p>This month was were we analyzed our data and presented our findings to stake holders. 
            Key take aways:
            
            Team Work is key: By working side by side with developers, data analysts, and product management. Time is used most effectivly to meet deadlines and meet business goals
            
            Understand Scope: Understanding what you can do is important, know how much time you need or how much time you have is essential. Do nothing which is of no use.
            
            Mistakes will be made: Make mistakes! But never make the same mistake twice! Learning from missed opportunities can lead to a plethora of good things.</p>

    <h2 class="center-h2">Opportunities</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Our scope of progress was limited. We were able to test as a team and understand where we could make improvements. At the time we wanted to make improvements and continue work, our research had come to an end and we had to pass off our efforts onto another team. I wish we could have come to some design desicions sooner. I think that our lack of confidence was what did us a number. Our designs were made and done in a timely matterl getting users to test is what took up the most time. </p>
